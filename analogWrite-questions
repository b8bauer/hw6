A. Why can you only use certain pins for analogWrite()?

Because most pins only have a PWM frequency of about 490 Hz, 
but in order to make writing PWM values look seamless, 
you need a pin with a PWM frequency of 980 Hz, 
which is only available on some.

B. What is the range the map() function maps the value to? Why this range?

The range that the map() function maps to when using analogWrite is 0-255 
because it is being outputted to a digital sources which reads data in bytes
which are written in binary code that can only add up to a maximum of 255.
